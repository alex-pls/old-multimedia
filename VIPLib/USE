USING VIPLib						   USING VIPLib

  Sample applications and tests are located in ./tests/ directory.
  Here are listed some simple task which may be easily build with VIPLib:



 MULTI-PLATFORM
-==============

	o Use frame objects (data structure)
		classes: ./source/vipFrame*.h

	o Read/Write any image
		class: ./source/codecs/vipCodec_BMP.h
		class: ./source/codecs/vipCodec_RAW.h
	
	o Process images
		classes: ./source/filters/*.h

	o Digital Filtering (lowpass, sobel, ..)
		class: ./source/filters/vipDigitalFilter.h
		class: ./source/math/vipDFMatrix.h

	o Motion Estimation related applications
		classes: ./source/motion/*.h

	o Thread Support
		class: ./source/vipThread.h



 LINUX only
-==========

	o Interface with most capture devices through Video4Linux
		class: ./source/inputs/vetVideo4Linux.h

	o Show images and videos (QT library)
		class: ./source/outputs/vetWindowQT.h	


 WINDOWS only
-============

	o Interface with most capture devices through DirectX (DirectShow)
		class: ./source/inputs/vetDirectXInput.h,
		class: ./source/inputs/vetDirectXInput2.h



 SOURCE CODE Hierarchy
-=====================

  Framework's standard class hierarchy:
	
	./source/		Base classes & interfaces
	./source/buffers/	Buffers utilities
	./source/codecs/	(de)coders (images and streams)
	./source/filters/	Filters
	./source/inputs/	Image/Video data sources
	./source/libETI/	ETILib support (image, picture)
	./source/math/		Math functions and utilities
	./source/network/	Networking related components
	./source/outputs/	Image/Video data output
	./source/vision/	Computer Vision and Motion related components



 STATIC Library
-==============

  VIPLib binaries are stored in ./lib folder, there is a full built and some
  special builts (useful for local building), read ./lib/README document
  for informations about each built and its content.
  
  If your interested to compile VIPLib on your system, read ./COMPILE document.
  
  You should have a look inside ./tests/Makefile and check projects in ./tests/mvc.



 LINUX Tips
-==========

  A very simple compilation command is:
	
	g++	myMainApp.cpp ../lib/VIPLib.a -o outputBin.out
