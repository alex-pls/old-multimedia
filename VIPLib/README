 What is it?
-===========

  Video Processing C++ Library, designed for testing and developing
  filters, (de)coders.

  VIPLib basic built is fully compatible with Windows and NIX operative systems,
  some special builts (not available on all platforms) require external libraries
  such as v4l, qt, gtk, DirectX.

  VIPLib implements many tools for Video processing, to ease the testing phase of your algorithm.



 More informations
-=================

  Project's documentation is available in HTML and other formats in ./docs directory.
  Frequenlty Asked Questions are listed in ./FAQS document, VIPLib developers
  are named in ./AUTHORS.

  An updated version of this document (and all distribution) is available online.



 Under Linux
-===========

  Library and new packages are currently compiled with GNU C++ Compiler 3.3.4 or later.
  Special builts supported on Linux:

	o V4L		[require video4linux library installed]
	o QT (GUI)	[require Trolltech QT library installed]
	o GTK (GUI)	[require GTK library installed]



 Under Windows
-=============

  Library and new packages are currently compiled with Visual C++ 6.0 or higher.
  Special builts supported on Windows:

	o DirectX	[require* DirectX SDK]




 Using
-=====

  Binaries (all) are stored in ./lib folder, read ./lib/README document
  for informations about each built (and its content).
  
  Read ./USE for informations about using VIPLib in your applications.
  Check Tests and Samples applications in ./tests folder.

 Compiling
-=========

  Read COMPILE for indepth informations;



 Extending
-=========

  VIPLib is very modular, it's quite easy for developers to add new packages 
  or extend existing packages.

  Developers interested in extending library should read ./EXTEND document and
  use Package Studio (available at mmLab), this tool creates base
  source and project files (available for Windows systems only).

  Read ./TODO if you wish join VIPLib project;
  Read ./BUGS for well know bugs and problems list;
