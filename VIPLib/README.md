# VIPLib - Video & Image Processing LIBrary Video Processing C++ Library, designed for testing and developingfilters, (de)coders.VIPLib (formerly VETLib) Project was started on 2005-06-13 and last updated on 2006-05-18.## Description
VIPLib basic built is fully compatible with Windows and NIX operative systems,some special builds (not available on all platforms) require external librariessuch as v4l, qt, gtk, DirectX.VIPLib implements many tools for Video processing, to ease the testing phase of your algorithm.
# UsingBinaries (all) are stored in ./lib folder, read ./lib/README documentfor informations about each built (and its content).Read ./USE for informations about using VIPLib in your applications.Check Tests and Samples applications in ./tests folder.## Under LinuxLibrary and new packages are currently compiled with GNU C++ Compiler 3.3.4 or later.Special builds supported on Linux:* V4L		[requires video4linux library installed]* QT (GUI)	[requires Trolltech QT library installed]* GTK (GUI)	[requires GTK library installed]## Under WindowsLibrary and new packages are currently compiled with Visual C++ 6.0 or higher.Special builds supported on Windows:* DirectX	[requires DirectX SDK]
