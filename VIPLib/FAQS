-==========================
 
 
   _______________________________________________________________________________
  |o
  |	What should I download?
  |	
  |_______________________________________________________________________________
  |
    	You should download and compile the source code from the SVN repository
     	and as installation package for windows (.MSI),
     	
     	If you are going to extend VIPLib with a filter, a codec or any component,
     	you should download (as always) the SDK archive and Package Studio.

  |o
  |	I just want to use DirectX / Video4Linux component to capture data
  |	for my application, ..without reading manuals :P
  |_______________________________________________________________________________
  |
    	Easy, with a text pad open one of these components (or all):
	
		./source/inputs/vipDirectXInput.h
		./source/inputs/vipDirectXInput2.h
		./source/inputs/vipVideo4Linux.h
	
	and their own test files:
	
		./tests/test_vipDirectXInput.cpp
		./tests/test_vipDirectXInput2.cpp
		./tests/test_vipVideo4Linux.cpp

	but you are probably more interested in these simple "applications":

		./tests/app_vipDirectXLamePlayer.cpp
		./tests/app_vipVideo4LinuxPlayer.cpp

	check them out, code is often commented and quite simple, you may take
	a look to tests' project files for building your own (or just edit them):
	
		./tests

	for more information check ./USE.
